	ReadMe for XQRunner

Documentation is pretty light still.  Take a look at
the src/junit tree for usage examples.  The source bundle
comes with a top-level Ant build.xml control file.  Just
type "ant all" to build everything.  The results of the
build are placed in the "deliverable" directory.  The
directory named "buildtmp" is temporary stuff that can
be deleted after the build.

   The binary bundle contains pre-built jar files (the
content of the deliverable directory) which you can use
without doing a build.
